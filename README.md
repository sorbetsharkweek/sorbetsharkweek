Most of what I do on pony.town is sit around and make ponies! Although if you wanna sit and chat I'd be happy to do it from beyond the character customisation screen!!! All hail the J button amirite?
Now you may be asking yourself "Alpine, what's a great guy like you doing on this godawful site known as github.com. Surely you are way too cool for this?" Well dear reader, I happen to be a sheep that follows everyone else. You should totally draw something on my straw page btw, or don't. It's not like I care or anything *she says while shaking and crying*.

The spaces where ur most likely to find me are (drum roll please) : docks, sonic and hedgehog both in pg and 18+ and last but not least the south park area(rest in peace our fallen soldier)
99% of the time I am rocking my Silver pony but when I'm feeling a little daring I will be Tweek or even *gasp* NIGHTWING???? That fandom is a little crazy but so am I.
I like to sit next to arguing ponies and chime in to "lol" or "hey so, this is crazy" which is why I frequent the docks obvi. I've never really been in a drama myself however, and I plan to keep it that way. If I find you even slightly annoying I'm sending you to the corner to think about what you've done, aka 15min hide. :3c

Of course you can friend request me just please understand that I am in fact an adult and will be wary around you unless I can find your age or age range somewhere, kids are crazy these days I'm sure you understand.
